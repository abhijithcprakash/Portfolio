    <h2>Research Projects</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Neuroevolution of language model for text generation</h3>
        <p>
          Normally when we are building deepleaarning models we have to selewct
          the numbert of layers adna many6 other hyperparameter and lat4er we to
          do hyperparameter tuning also. So through my project i have developed
          a frame work where i am using genetic algorithm to find the best
          model, that is we will specify the range for each parameter like
          number of layers nurons or activation function and learning rate then
          then this will represented as a chromosome in genetica lafgorithm and
          wer will have a popoulation of these chromosome which will bw evolved
          using genetic algorithm resul5ting in a best model with best
          parameter, removing the need for manually designing the models.
        </p>

      <li>
        <h3>Attention GAN for Text generation using policy Gradient</h3>
        <p>
          GAN models are really good for generating new images but their use in
          natural language generation has been always less. Gan models are made
          for continous type data and it is hard for using it for text kind of
          data because it is discrtete in nature there is a issue in
          backpropagating the loss. now to mitigate this issue we can use the
          policy gradient to train the gan model. WHERE the generator is the
          agent and it will generate text and the discriminator will classify
          the text as real or fake and will give reward with which the generator
          is trained. And on top of this method opf training the generator and
          discriminator of my model is made of attention network which has
          proven it s efficiency over many years throughdifferentr models. SO
          attention gan address all the gaps that was oocuring in this area of
          research.

    <h2>Other projects</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Image Caption generator</h3>
        <p>
          The Image Caption Generator is a deep learning-based application
          designed to automatically generate descriptive captions for images.
          Combining the power of computer vision and natural language processing
          (NLP), the project showcases how artificial intelligence can interpret
          visual data and articulate it in human-readable text. The model
          achieved significant accuracy in generating relevant and concise
          captions. For instance, an input image of a dog playing with a ball
          was captioned as: "A dog running with a ball in its mouth on a grassy
          field."

        <h3>Driver drowsines detection</h3>
        <p>
          Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a real-time application designed
          to enhance road safety by monitoring drivers and detecting signs of
          drowsiness. This project leverages computer vision and machine
          learning techniques to analyze visual cues and provide timely alerts,
          reducing the risk of accidents caused by fatigue. This project
          enhances road safety by providing an automated solution to monitor
          driver fatigue, thus reducing the number of accidents caused by drowsy
          driving. The technology is scalable and can be integrated into
          existing vehicle systems, contributing to the development of smarter,
          safer roads.

        <h3>Minute defect Detection</h3>
        <p>
          In this project, I developed several deep learning models to detect a
          specific, small-type defect occurring on a particular product in a
          manufacturing process. The challenge was to accurately identify these
          tiny defects, which required high precision in both model performance
          and image quality. To address this, I utilized pretrained ImageNet
          models as a starting point and fine-tuned them to detect the subtle
          defects. Additionally, I implemented the YOLO (You Only Look Once)
          object detection algorithm, which is well-suited for real-time
          detection tasks, to further enhance the model’s accuracy and speed in
          identifying defects. The model was then deployed on an edge device,
          the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, which allowed for real-time processing in the
          manufacturing environment. I integrated necessary cameras and sensors
          with the Jetson Nano to capture and process images of the product,
          ensuring optimal conditions for defect detection. This edge deployment
          reduced the reliance on cloud processing.

        <h3>Detection of empty slots on an Auto Coner Machine</h3>
        <p>
          The Auto Coner machine, used in the textile industry, has multiple
          slots where bobbins with wound yarn are placed. The feeding process is
          typically done manually by laborers, leading to inefficiencies and
          potential errors. To address this, we developed an object detection
          model that automatically identifies empty slots on the machine. By
          leveraging computer vision and deep learning techniques, the model
          detects the presence or absence of bobbins in each slot. The system
          uses a camera to capture real-time images of the machine's slots,
          which are then processed by the object detection model. The model is
          trained to detect both occupied and empty slots, providing an accurate
          count of the empty slots. Based on this information, a new automated
          system is triggered to feed the required number of bobbins into the
          empty slots, eliminating the need for manual labor. This automation
          not only enhances efficiency but also reduces the risk of human error,
          ensuring consistent production quality.

        <h3>Arm Exoskeleton for Rehabilitation</h3>
        <p>
          We developed a wearable arm exoskeleton controlled via a mobile app,
          designed to assist individuals affected by stroke- related paralysis.
          Many stroke survivors experience arm paralysis, which can be partially
          treated through physiotherapy. However, the challenges of accessing
          consistent therapy and the daily difficulties patients face prompted
          us to create this solution. The exoskeleton allows patients to perform
          physiotherapy exercises independently at home, guided by the mobile
          app, reducing the need for continuous in-person therapy sessions.
          Additionally, it provides assistance in performing daily tasks. The
          exoskeleton is 3D printed, with movement facilitated by servo motors
          and gear systems. These motors and sensors are managed by
          microcontrollers, ensuring precise control and responsiveness for
          effective rehabilitation and daily task support.
